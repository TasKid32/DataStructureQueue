# Queue Operation Simulator using JavaFX

This JavaFX application simulates basic queue operations such as enqueue, dequeue, and displaying the current state of the queue. 

*Features:*
- Add elements to the queue (enqueue)
- Remove elements from the queue (dequeue)
- Display the current elements in the queue via an alert popup
- Visual representation of the queue elements with smooth animation on adding new elements
- Input validation and user-friendly alert messages

The program uses Java's LinkedList as the underlying queue implementation and provides a simple graphical user interface to interact with the queue.

*Note:* This project is a console and GUI hybrid, primarily for educational purposes to demonstrate queue operations visually.
